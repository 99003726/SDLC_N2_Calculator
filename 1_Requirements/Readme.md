# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

**Generally businessman, engineers ,students and scientist uses calculator but they use different calculator for each purpose.**

## What:

**There are already so many types of calculator that exist in the market already for making our life easier. Few of the calculators we have researched are basic calculator, scientific calculator, financial, graphing ,printing calculator etc.**

## When:

**This requirement of this type of calculator started because firstly manual calculations are difficult.**

## Where:

**It can be used for design analysis of various mechanical equipment’s such as spaceships, vehicle’s speed and diagnostic analysis etc.**

## How:

**We are going to make functions the necessary physics phenomena’s which are difficult to calculate manually.**
